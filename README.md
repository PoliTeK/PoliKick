## LTSpice simulation
This project uses [LTSpice][LTSpice] to simulate the kick drum. The simulation for each stage can be found under the `spice` folder.

Some simulations use external components, such as the TL072, which must be added manually to one of the folders where LTSpice looks up schematics and symbols.
